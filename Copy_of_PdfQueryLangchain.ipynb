Even if you don’t make a claim on your car, it’s important to let us \\nknow about the accident as quickly as possible. This will enable us to contact the other party and resolve the entire claim, giving you the best service and keep the costs down.\\nHow it works\\nTo get the ball rolling, we’ll need to know things like:\\n>Your personal details.\\n>Your policy number.\\n>Your car registration number.\\n>A description of the loss or damage.\\n>If you’ve been in an accident, the other \\ndriver’s details.\\nPlease have these handy when you get in touch.Other information you need to send us\\nIf you get any communication such as any \\nnotice or form from a court, any threat of legal action or similar, please contact us straight away. We’ll deal with it or tell you what you need to do. You must also give us any other relevant information, documents or help we might need to process your claim, and pay any charges for sending such information. If you’re unsure if a document is relevant, please give it to us anyway.\\nAvoid increasing the amount claimed\\nYou must not do, or refrain from doing, anything \\nthat would increase the amount of the claim without our written permission. For example, admit liability for, or negotiate to settle, any claim.\\nPaying the excess\\nFor some claims, you’ll need to pay an \\nexcess. You can find your excesses on \\nyour car insurance details. Each driver \\nmay have different excesses. We won’t \\ncharge an excess if:\\n>You’re in an accident that we believe is not your fault and we can make a full recovery of our costs. Sometimes you may have to pay the excess while we’re looking into the claim, \\nbut we’ll refund it once it’s proven you’re not to blame and we can recover our costs.\\n>Your car is stolen from a private locked garage.\\nIf you’re leasing your car or buying on hire purchase\\nIf your car can’t be repaired and you’re leasing \\nit, we’ll pay any claims to the lease company, \\nbecause they are the legal owners of the car.\\nIf your car can’t be repaired and you’re buying \\nit on hire purchase or a similar agreement, we’ll \\npay any claims to the legal owner. We’ll only pay any remaining balance to you if you have the option to become the full owner at the end of the agreement.Page 7Making a claim\\nHow repairs and replacements work\\nThis page explains how we’ll repair your car. \\nWe’ll only do this if it makes financial sense for \\nus to do so. For more details, see: \\n>Section 2: Fire and theft on page 14. \\n>Section 4: Accidental damage on page 18. \\n>Section 5: Windscreen damage on page 20.\\nRepairs to your car\\nIf our approved repairer carries out the repairs, \\nyou do not need an estimate, and you will benefit\\nfrom our 5-year Guarantee. This means parts, \\nmaterials and workmanship provided by our \\napproved repairer are guaranteed for five years,\\nunless you sell your car or end your lease. Your \\ncar will not qualify for repair under our 5-year \\nGuarantee if the cause is a lack of maintenance,\\nwear and tear, or a subsequent incident. \\nWhere we have agreed this with you, \\nreasonable and necessary repairs can be carried out at a repairer of your choice. However, you must give us full details of the incident and we must approve the repairer’s detailed assessment of the repairs before the work begins. We may then make the arrangements for the repairs ourselves. \\nWhere the repairs are carried out at a repairer \\nof your choice, those repairs will NOT be guaranteed by us even though we may pay for them directly. For the purposes of this policy, \\nthose repairs will not be treated as being carried out by our approved repairer.\\nIf there is a problem with any aspect of the repair, your first port of call is the repairer who did the original work. If you’re still unhappy with any aspect of the repairs, please let us know.\\nWindscreen repairs\\nWe may decide to replace your car’s glass \\nwith glass that hasn’t been made by your car’s \\nmanufacturer but is of a similar standard. If you arrange windscreen repairs or \\nreplacement with someone who isn’t an approved windscreen supplier, you don’t need to get our approval beforehand. However, we’ll only cover a limited amount – see ‘Section 5: Windscreen damage’ on page 20.The excess amounts for windscreen repairs \\nand replacement are shown on your car \\ninsurance details.\\nReplacing parts in your car\\nWe may decide to repair your car with \\nparts that haven’t been made by your car’s \\nmanufacturer, but that are of a similar \\nstandard. This can include recycled parts. If any part or accessory is not available, the most we’ll pay for that part will be the cost shown in the manufacturer’s last UK price list (plus reasonable fitting costs).\\nRemoving, delivering and storing your car\\nIf we’re dealing with your claim under sections 2 \\nor 4 of your  policy and your car can’t be driven, \\nwe’ll cover reasonable costs to take it to the nearest suitable repairer. \\nWe’ll help you and your passengers make \\narrangements to get home, to your original destination or take you to a safe place.\\nWe’ll also cover the reasonable cost of delivering your car to you (at the address shown \\non your car insurance details) after it’s repaired.\\nIf we need to put your car into safe storage at \\nany time, we’ll cover the reasonable cost of storage.\\nIf your car is written off\\nIf your car is written off and we agree to settle \\nyour claim on that basis, we will have met our responsibilities to you under the policy.\\nWe will not refund any of your premium if you pay annually. If you pay by instalments under a credit agreement you must pay to us (1) all instalment payments that have already fallen due under the credit agreement and remain unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance under the credit agreement. If we agree to pay your claim and you have not paid the amounts due to us under (1) and (2) above, we may reduce the amount that we pay in settlement of your claim by the amount that you owe us. Alternatively, we may write to you asking you for the full payment\\n.\\nOnce we settle your claim, your car will become \\nour property and you must send us the registration document. All cover will then end unless we agree differently.Page 8We’ll provide cover up to the amounts shown below, depending on the type of claim and the level of cover.\\nPlease see under each section for further details and any restrictions. If the section of your policy you are \\nlooking to claim under includes an excess, we’ll pay you up to the amount shown in the table after your \\nexcess has been deducted.What your cover

This will include looking \\nafter your interests in any inquiry or other court\\nproceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. Your appointed representative can be:\\n>From a preferred law firm that we suggest.\\n>Your own choice of appointed representative\\n– however you can’t choose your own appointed representative if it’s a contract dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.\\nIf you choose an appointed representative who \\nisn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree \\nto our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover \\ntheir costs from the date they agree to our terms \\nof appointment .\\nYou’ll have a separate contract with your appointed representative. If they charge any costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible for paying these.\\nChecking whether your claim has a reasonable \\nchance of succeeding\\nBefore we go ahead, we must agree with your \\nappointed representative that your claim has a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will \\nonly provide this cover as long as we and your appointed representative agree your claim has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the \\nduration of the claim. This can change during your claim. \\nSometimes the costs of a legal action may \\nbe too much in relation to the value of your \\nclaim, this relates to a legal test that is referred to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may not provide further cover for your claim. When looking at how much your claim will cost to take legal action versus the potential benefit to be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider things like: \\n>The difficulty of the case. Cases which are \\nmore difficult usually have greater legal costs\\nattached to them.\\n>The potential total value of the case. This includes the amount of damages you may be able to recover from the other party.\\n>The non-financial value of the case. Sometimes your claim will have a benefit to you which is difficult to value in financial terms but is still worth pursuing. For these claims your \\nappointed representative  will \\ntake the benefit to you into account when calculating the total value of your claim.\\n>If it would be reasonable to spend more in pursuing a claim than the benefit you would get in doing so.\\nYour \\nappointed representative  will assess the \\npotential value to be gained in pursuing your case and the cost to take legal action.\\nIf there are conflicting opinions about whether \\nyour claim is likely to succeed, we’ll ask you to get an expert opinion from a barrister. We’ll agree which barrister with you.\\nIf the barrister agrees with you, you won’t need \\nto pay for their advice. If they don’t agree with you, you’ll have to pay the costs for their advice.Section 7: Motor Legal Cover continuedSettling or ending your claim\\nOffers to settle your claim\\nYou must tell us if anyone:\\n>Offers to settle your claim.\\n>Makes a payment into court.\\nIf you refuse to accept an offer or payment \\nthat we or your appointed representative\\nthink you should accept, we can refuse to cover any further costs.\\nApproval to settle or end your claim\\nUnless we agree, you must not:\\n>Stop, settle, negotiate or withdraw your claim.\\n>Dismiss your appointed representative.\\nWe won’t withhold our agreement to take these \\nactions without good reason.\\nWhen we might choose to settle your claim\\nWe can settle your claim outside of court if we \\nthink it makes financial sense to do this. We’ll do \\nthis by covering you for:\\n>The amount you’re likely to be awarded by a \\ncourt.\\n>The equivalent financial value, if your claim is not for damages.\\nChecking costs\\nWe have the right to have costs:\\n>Certified by an appropriate professional body.\\n>Checked by an auditor (for example a Costs \\nLawyer) that we choose.\\n>Assessed by a court.\\nRecovering costs\\nIf your costs can be recovered from somewhere \\nelse, you must tell your appointed representative\\nto do this. If we’ve paid costs that you then \\nrecover, you must pay the money back to us.We’ll share recovered costs with you if:\\n>We refused to cover further costs and you \\npaid more costs to end your claim.\\n>You paid the difference between the costs we \\noffered your appointed representative and \\nthe costs they charged.\\nWe’ll split any recovered costs to reflect who \\npaid costs originally.
